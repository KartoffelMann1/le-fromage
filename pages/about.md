## Transcript
"For a long time, I’ve been fascinated with the story of the irish diaspora in Canada. Stories about downtrodden urban Catholics living in neighbourhoods such as Corktown or Cabbagetown, marginalized by the Protestant majority. This belief has dominated the popular imagination through family histories and pop culture for the better part of 40 years. However, how true is this? What was life like for Irish Catholic immigrants in the first half of the 19th century? To help me unravel this mess, I sat down with Professor Mark McGowen from the University of Toronto. Professor McGowen is a historian of the Archdiocese of Toronto and coauthor of At the “Gathering Place”. We’ll discuss the history of Toronto’s oldest catholic parish and its role in the history of the irish diaspora in Toronto.
	St Paul’s Basilica was consecrated in 1822 as a parish in the Diocese of Kingston. At the time, Toronto was a very different place. The Town of York as it was known at the time amounted to little more than the government of Upper Canada, and a military outpost on Lake Ontario. York was growing, however, and the need for a small catholic parish in the largely protestant town was apparent. The groundwork for the parish dates back to 1807 when six Catholics in the town of York met to draft up plans for a church on a land grant from the crown. At this point, the Catholic population of York was minuscule. York was overwhelmingly English and protestant, with a tiny minority of French Canadians. The Irish immigrants who settled in York were mostly protestant and rural 
These immigrants mostly settled in rural areas around Toronto, which today is the inner suburbs. 
	These settlers mostly came from Ireland’s fairly wealthy northern counties, such as Antrim, Tyrone, and Derry. Politics in York was dominated by the Orange Lodge, a fraternity named after William of Orange, and dedicated to his victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Membership in the Orange Lodge was a defacto prerequisite to holding political office.
	Despite this, the relationship between Protestants and Catholics was fairly civil in the pre-famine period. Bishop Michael Power had a very good relationship with the Anglican bishop John Strachan. York’s French Families were also well respected in Protestant society. Likewise, there was little opposition from the Orange Lodge when the Diocese of Toronto was formally established in 1841.
	Beginning in 1845, Toronto saw a massive boom in Catholic immigration. A combination of potato blight and inadequate aid from the British government plunged Ireland into one of the deadliest famines in the history of western europe. The famine prompted many families to emigrate in mass to North America. Most of them were poor Catholic farmers from Ireland’s central, western, and southern counties. Many of those emigrants made their way to Toronto, exponentially increasing the Catholic population. The growth of the city's catholic population created a need to expand the diocese. In 1887, a newer, larger church building was commissioned for St Paul’s. Architect Joseph Conolly designed a new building, a near replica of St Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. The uptick in immigration because of the famine, combined with the emergence of a more militant form of Catholicism courtesy of the election of Pope Pius IX created a massive wave of anti catholicism across the city. Violent clashes erupted throughout the city, especially during the St Patrick’s Day, and Orange parades.
	Parishes like St Paul's served as more than a simple place of worship for its parishioners. The Parish sat as the center of a network of schools and hospitals established by various religious orders, serving as the social safety net for Irish Catholics at a time before Canada had established a welfare state. In a sense, the parish was the nucleus of the community for these immigrants. 
	By the turn of the century, things began to cool down between Catholics and Protestants, and Catholics began to achieve greater economic and political success. At the same time, the Orange Lodge’s grip on power began to loosen. The Irish Catholics had begun to assimilate into the wider English-speaking population of Toronto, and the government began to slowly take over many of the services that were once under the control of the diocese. The easing of immigration restrictions also began to shift the demographics of parishes like St Paul’s, which were once overwhelmingly Irish, to now have Italian, Portuguese, French, and some German immigrants attending. These immigrants, who came to Canada in search of better economic opportunities, would be the first among several waves of immigration. Both Protestant loyalist and Irish Catholic identities began to lose relevance as Toronto became a far more cosmopolitan city.
	Today, St Paul’s stands as a monument to these immigrant communities. The people that this parish once served are long gone, but the church itself is still in use. In a way, this makes St Paul’s unique. It's not a museum, a plaque, or a statue but instead a place of worship that continues to serve a similar purpose to this day."
